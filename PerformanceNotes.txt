- Docker compose 3 images: Redis, Kafka, Java Application
- Performance tuning
- Kafka Cluster Performance tuning
================
Producer:
- Producer should have acks=0 for better throughput as it will not wait for broker to acknowledge
- Producer.type=1 to make it asynch
- Messages in batches
- queue.buffer.max.ms
- batch.num.messages
- These two properties could be set to improve throughput of Producer: Compression: I/O and CPU to balanced
- compression.codec property 
- gzip and snappy are two compression techniques
- timeouts, retries

Broker:
- 1 partition per physical disc storage to ensure log writing I/O is not a bottleneck
- Partition load distribution using reassignment script
- With these parameters: generate, execute, verify
- num.io.threads=number of discs
- log.flush.interval.messages, log retention, Failure detection, Replication settings

Consumer:
- replica.high.watermark.checkpoint.interval.ms
- Message offset to read
================
Use Case 1:
- Increase number of partitions: 3
- Create 1 lakh messages: Send this multiple times
- What to observe?
